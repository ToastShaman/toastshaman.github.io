Hi, my name is Kevin and I'm a London based Senior Software Engineer at [Zuhlke Engineering Ltd.](http://www.zuehlke.com/)

Here are some of my projects:

### dropwizard-auth-jwt
An implementation of the JSON Web Token (JWT) draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-20 for dropwizard 7.0.

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between
two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that
is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).
